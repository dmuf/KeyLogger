# Keylogger

A simple **keylogger** implemented in **Python** to capture keystrokes and log them. This project is for educational purposes only. Please use it responsibly and with the consent of others.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes on the system.
- Captures each keypress along with the timestamp.
- Saves logs to a local file.
- Built with Python's `pynput` library for keypress detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Libraries: `pynput`)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Dependencies

To run the keylogger, you need to install the required dependencies. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the following:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Keylogger.git
```

### Run the Keylogger

Navigate to the project directory and run the `keylogger.py` script:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

The keylogger will start recording keystrokes and logging them to a file.

> **Note:** Running a keylogger is **illegal** without the explicit consent of the user. Use this project for educational purposes only and ensure proper legal authorization.

## Usage

Once the keylogger is running, it will capture all keypresses and save them in a log file. You can customize the log file name and location in the code.

The keylogger logs each keystroke, including timestamps, in a **plain text file**.

## Example Output

The log file will contain entries like:

```
2025-04-11 10:30:15 - Key: 'a'
2025-04-11 10:30:16 - Key: 'b'
2025-04-11 10:30:17 - Key: 'enter'
```

## Security and Ethical Considerations

- This keylogger is for **educational purposes only**.
- Do not use it on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to monitor.
- Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.
